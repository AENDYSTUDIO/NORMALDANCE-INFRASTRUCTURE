- **Change**: Enhanced PostgreSQL setup with health checks and better timeout handling
- **Improvements**:
  - Added health check configuration to PostgreSQL container
  - Implemented timeout with bash command for better reliability
  - Added progress feedback during database initialization

### 3. Enhanced Docker Health Check

- **File**: `Dockerfile`
- **Change**: Improved HEALTHCHECK command
- **Improvements**:
  - Extended timeout from 3s to 10s
  - Reduced start period from 10s to 5s
  - Changed check command to use curl against the actual health endpoint

### 4. Improved Test Script Portability

- **File**: `scripts/test-all.sh`
- **Change**: Made tool checking more portable and enhanced database setup function
- **Improvements**:
  - Replaced bash-specific array syntax with POSIX-compatible approach
  - Added comprehensive database setup function with health checks

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets

Ensure the following secrets are configured in your GitHub repository:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK`
- `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SNYK_TOKEN`

### 2. Add Caching to Workflows

Consider adding dependency caching to speed up builds:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
    cache: "npm"
    cache-dependency-path: "**/package-lock.json"
```

### 3. Improve Error Reporting

Add better error reporting in workflows:

```yaml
- name: Notify on failure
  if: failure()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

### 4. Parallelize Jobs Where Possible

Review job dependencies and parallelize non-dependent jobs to reduce overall build time.

## Testing the Fixes

1. Commit the changes to a feature branch
2. Create a pull request to trigger the CI pipeline
3. Monitor the workflow execution for any remaining issues
4. Check that all jobs complete successfully:
   - Security scans
   - Code quality checks
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests
   - Build and deployment

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these changes, you should see:

- Reduced CI/CD errors
- Faster build times
- More reliable test execution
- Better error reporting
- Improved deployment success rate

If you continue to experience issues, check the GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages and consult the documentation for the individual tools being used.
