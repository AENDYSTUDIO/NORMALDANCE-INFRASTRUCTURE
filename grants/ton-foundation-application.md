## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name
**NormalDance** - Revolutionary Web3 Music Platform

### Project Description
NormalDance is an innovative Web3 music platform that leverages TON blockchain technology to create a fair, transparent, and community-driven music ecosystem. The platform combines NFT ownership, DeFi protocols, and anti-piracy technology to revolutionize how music is created, distributed, and consumed.

### Problem Statement
The current music industry suffers from:
- **Unfair Artist Compensation**: Artists receive only 10-15% of streaming revenue
- **Lack of Transparency**: Complex royalty structures hide actual earnings
- **Limited Fan Engagement**: Passive consumption without ownership or community
- **High Barriers to Entry**: New artists struggle to gain visibility and monetization
- **Centralized Control**: Major labels and platforms control distribution and pricing

### Solution
NormalDance addresses these issues through:
1. **NFT Music Ownership**: Fans can purchase NFT versions of tracks, albums, and exclusive content
2. **DeFi Integration**: Dual-currency system (TON + NDT tokens) with staking rewards
3. **Community-Driven Features**: Fan voting, community-curated playlists, direct artist-fan communication
4. **Anti-Piracy Technology**: Blockchain-based content protection and automated DMCA compliance
5. **ðŸ†• G.rave 2.0**: Digital Memorial System for preserving musical legacy on TON blockchain

## 2. G.rave 2.0: Revolutionary Digital Memorial System

### Overview
G.rave 2.0 is an innovative digital memorial platform built on TON blockchain that creates eternal NFT-based memorials for deceased musicians. It's the world's first blockchain-powered "digital cemetery" for music, combining 3D visualization, multi-chain donations, and permanent IPFS storage.
