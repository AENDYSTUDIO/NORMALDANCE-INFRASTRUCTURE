# ✅ FINAL EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CHECKLIST

## 📋 Before Submission

### Step 1: Generate Visual Assets (15 minutes)

#### ⚡ Quick Method (Python Script)
```bash
cd grants/assets

# Create this file and run it:
python generate_all_assets.py
```

**Generates automatically:**
- ✅ `demo_qr_code.png` - QR to demo page
- ✅ `budget_breakdown.png` - Pie chart (80/13/7%)
- ✅ `timeline_roadmap.png` - 2025 milestones

**Manual step (5 min):**
- ⏳ `grave_vinyl_demo.gif` - Record from `/grave/demo`
  - Use ScreenToGif (Windows) or QuickTime (Mac)
  - 3 seconds loop, 800x600px, <2MB

---

### Step 2: Insert Assets into PDF (10 minutes)

#### Option A: Markdown → PDF (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pandoc first: https://pandoc.org/installing.html

# Convert with images embedded
pandoc TON_GRANT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md \
  -o G.rave_2.0_Executive_Summary.pdf \
  --pdf-engine=xelatex \
  -V geometry:margin=1in \
  -V fontsize=11pt

# Result: Professional PDF with all visuals
```

#### Option B: Google Docs (Easiest)
1. Copy content from `TON_GRANT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
2. Paste into Google Docs
3. Insert images at marked placeholders:
   - After "Elevator Pitch" → insert `grave_vinyl_demo.gif`
   - After "Budget Breakdown" → insert `budget_breakdown.png`
   - After "Timeline" → insert `timeline_roadmap.png`
   - In "Contact" section → insert `demo_qr_code.png`
4. Format tables and boxes
5. File → Download → PDF

### Step 4: Combine with Full Application (5 minutes)

└── TON_Foundation_Grant_Application.pdf  (full document)

Email text: "Please see Executive Summary attached, with full application following."
```

#### Option 2: Single PDF
```bash
# Merge PDFs (use https://www.ilovepdf.com/merge_pdf)
1. Upload Executive Summary PDF
2. Upload Full Application PDF  
3. Merge in order
4. Download: G.rave_2.0_Complete_Application.pdf
```

## 🚀 5-Minute Express Version

**If you're in a rush:**

1. **Skip GIF** - Use screenshot instead (30 sec)
   ```bash
   # Take screenshot of vinyl at /grave/demo
   # Save as grave_vinyl_screenshot.png
   ```

2. **Use online tools** - No Python needed (3 min)
   - QR: https://www.qr-code-generator.com/
   - Pie Chart: https://www.meta-chart.com/pie
   - Timeline: https://venngage.com/timeline

3. **Submit markdown** - If TON accepts .md files (1 min)
   ```bash
   # Just attach the markdown with asset links
   # No PDF conversion needed
   ```

**Total: 5 minutes to submission-ready state**
