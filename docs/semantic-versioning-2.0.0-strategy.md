# Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Strategy for NormalDANCE

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Semantic Versioning (SemVer) 2.0.0 for the NormalDANCE project. Semantic Versioning is a set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.

## Version Format

NormalDANCE versions follow the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** version: Incremented when making incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version: Incremented when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version: Incremented when making backward-compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.

## Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions may be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version:

Examples:

- `1.0.0-alpha`
- `1.0.0-alpha.1`
- `1.0.0-0.3.7`
- `1.0.0-x.7.z.92`
- `1.0.0-beta.1`
- `1.0.0-rc.1`

### Pre-release Types

NormalDANCE uses the following pre-release types:

1. **Alpha** (`alpha`): Early development versions for internal testing
2. **Beta** (`beta`): Versions for external testing with limited audience
3. **Release Candidate** (`rc`): Near-final versions ready for production testing

## Build Metadata

Build metadata may be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version:

Examples:

- `1.0.0+20130313144700`
- `1.0.0+exp.sha.5114f85`
- `1.0.0-alpha+exp.sha.514f85`

## Version Increment Rules

### Patch Version (Z)

Incremented when:

- Bug fixes that do not affect the API
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Security patches that don't break compatibility
- Code refactoring that doesn't change functionality

### Minor Version (Y)

Incremented when:

- New functionality that is backward-compatible
- New API endpoints
- Deprecation of existing functionality (but not removal)
- Substantial new features
- Minor dependency updates

### Major Version (X)

Incremented when:

- Incompatible API changes
- Removing deprecated functionality
- Major architectural changes
- Breaking changes to existing APIs
- Major dependency upgrades that break compatibility

## Commit Message Conventions

To automate version detection, NormalDANCE follows conventional commit messages:

| Commit Type        | Version Impact | Description              |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `feat:`            | MINOR          | New feature              |
| `fix:`             | PATCH          | Bug fix                  |
| `feat!:`           | MAJOR          | Breaking change feature  |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` | MAJOR          | Explicit breaking change |
| `docs:`            | PATCH          | Documentation changes    |
| `style:`           | PATCH          | Code style changes       |
| `refactor:`        | PATCH          | Code refactoring         |
| `perf:`            | PATCH          | Performance improvements |
| `test:`            | PATCH          | Test changes             |
| `build:`           | PATCH          | Build system changes     |
| `ci:`              | PATCH          | CI configuration changes |
| `chore:`           | PATCH          | Maintenance tasks        |

## Pre-release Workflow

### Alpha Releases

1. Initial development versions
2. Internal testing only
3. May be unstable
4. Version format: `x.y.z-alpha.n`

### Beta Releases

1. Feature-complete versions
2. Limited external testing
3. More stable than alpha
4. Version format: `x.y.z-beta.n`

### Release Candidates

1. Near-final versions
2. Extensive testing
3. Production-like environment testing
4. Version format: `x.y.z-rc.n`

## Build Metadata Usage

Build metadata is used to track:

- Build timestamps
- Git commit hashes
- CI/CD pipeline information
- Environment information

Example: `1.5.0+build.20251009.sha.abc1234.env.prod`

## Version Management Tools

### Version Manager Script

The enhanced version manager script (`scripts/version-manager-enhanced.js`) provides:

1. **Version Bumping**:

   - `bump patch` - Increment patch version
   - `bump minor` - Increment minor version
   - `bump major` - Increment major version
   - `bump prepatch` - Create pre-release of next patch version
   - `bump preminor` - Create pre-release of next minor version
   - `bump premajor` - Create pre-release of next major version

2. **Pre-release Creation**:

   - `prerelease alpha` - Create alpha pre-release
   - `prerelease beta` - Create beta pre-release
   - `prerelease rc` - Create release candidate

3. **Version Information**:
   - `current` - Show current version
   - `report` - Generate version report
   - `tags` - List version tags
   - `changelog` - Generate changelog

### Package.json Integration

The version is stored in `package.json` and automatically updated by the version manager:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.4"
}
```

## Changelog Management

### Format

Changelogs follow the Keep a Changelog format with additional sections:

```markdown
## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-09

2. Changes are merged to development branches
3. CI/CD pipeline runs tests and validation

### 2. Pre-release Phase

1. Create pre-release versions for testing
2. Deploy to test environments
3. Gather feedback and fix issues
4. Progress through alpha ‚Üí beta ‚Üí rc stages

### 3. Release Phase

1. Final validation in release candidate
2. Create final version (remove pre-release tag)
3. Generate and publish release artifacts
4. Deploy to production
5. Create Git tag and GitHub release

### 4. Post-release

1. Update documentation
2. Notify stakeholders
3. Monitor for issues
4. Plan next version

## Branch Strategy Integration

### Main Branch

- Contains production-ready code
- Releases are created from this branch
- Only stable versions are merged here

### Development Branch

- Active development happens here
- Pre-release versions are created from this branch
- Feature branches are merged here

### Feature Branches

- Individual features are developed here
- Follow naming convention: `feature/feature-name`
- Use conventional commit messages

### Release Branches

- Created for major releases
- Follow naming convention: `release/vX.Y.Z`
- Stabilization happens here

## Compatibility Guidelines

### API Compatibility
