# Telegram Mini App Integration

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Telegram Mini App for NormalDance, which allows users to access core platform features directly from the Telegram app. The integration includes music streaming, NFT marketplace, staking, analytics, social payments, and Web3 wallet connectivity.

## Architecture

The Telegram Mini App integration consists of several key components:

1. **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for handling Mini App requests
2. **Authentication System**: Telegram Web App authentication
3. **Feature Integration**: Core platform features accessible via Telegram
4. **Web3 Integration**: Solana wallet connectivity and token operations

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/telegram/auth` - Authenticates users via Telegram Web App data
- `GET /api/telegram/features` - Returns available platform features
- `POST /api/telegram/features/:featureName` - Executes specific platform features
- `GET/POST /api/telegram/web3` - Handles Web3 wallet integration

### Webhook Handler

- `POST /api/telegram/webhook` - Processes incoming updates from Telegram

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User opens the Mini App in Telegram
2. Telegram passes authentication data to the Mini App
3. Mini App sends this data to our backend for validation
4. Backend validates the data against Telegram's requirements
5. If valid, a JWT token is generated for the session

### Feature Integration

Each platform feature is exposed through the `/api/telegram/features` endpoint with specific action parameters:

- Music: list, play, search tracks
- NFT: list, buy, sell NFTs
- Staking: stake/unstake tokens, view staking info
- Analytics: view user stats, platform overview
- Payments: send/receive payments, view history

### Web3 Integration

The Web3 integration allows users to:

- Connect Solana wallets
- Transfer tokens (SOL, NDT)
- Stake/unstake NDT tokens
- Swap tokens
- Mint and manage NFTs
- View portfolio and transaction history

## Security Considerations

- All requests must be authenticated with a valid JWT token
- Telegram authentication data is validated against Telegram's requirements
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Sensitive operations require additional verification

## Error Handling

Common error responses:

- 400: Bad Request - Missing required parameters
- 401: Unauthorized - Invalid or missing authentication token
- 404: Not Found - Requested resource doesn't exist
- 500: Internal Server Error - Unexpected server error

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests for:

- Authentication flows
- Feature access controls
- Web3 operations
- Error conditions
- Performance under load

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional blockchains
- Advanced DeFi features
- Social features within the Mini App
- Enhanced analytics and recommendations
