# Task 5: Mock Data Removal - Completed ✅

## Summary
Removed hardcoded mock data from production code and moved to proper testing fixtures.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Mock Data Fixtures
**File:** `src/__mocks__/tracks.ts`
- Moved all mock tracks to dedicated mocks directory
- Moved mock artists data
- Properly documented as development/testing only
- Prevents accidental import in production

### 2. Refactored Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)
**Before:** Hardcoded mock data in component
**After:** 
- ✅ Fetches real data from `/api/tracks` in production
- ✅ Uses mock data only in development
- ✅ Added loading state
- ✅ Added error handling with logger
- ✅ Graceful fallback for empty states
- ✅ Type-safe with interfaces

### 3. Fixed API Route Mock Values
**File:** `src/app/api/tracks/route.ts`
- ✅ Removed hardcoded `'default-artist-id'`
- ✅ Added proper authentication check
- ✅ Returns 401 if no artist ID in production

**File:** `src/app/api/grave/donations/route.ts`
- ✅ Removed fake transaction hash generation
- ✅ Added TODO for real blockchain integration
